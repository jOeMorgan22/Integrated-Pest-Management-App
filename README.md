# Integrated-Pest-Management-App
Personal project that attempts to tie together some higher level concepts including : authentication/authorization, Json web tokens, user roles, user verification, etc. 

Integrated Pest Management is the philosophy that all instances of pests and diseases in a horticulture setting should be observed and recorded. Thorough documentation allows growers to find emerging trends and mitigate issues while they are still in their infancy. This project is a simple Spring Boot Application that allows for the creation of user groups consisting of admins and users. While either role may contribute reports or actions taken, only members with admin priviledges may resolve issues or view collective group contributions.
